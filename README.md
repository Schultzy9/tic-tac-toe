## Tic-Tac-toe

A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two game modes included:

* **vsPlayer** - alternate turns with your friends in a two player Tic-Tac-Toe showdown.
* **vsComputer** - see if you have the guts to take on the computer in a Tic-Tac-Toe war!

Game modes are accessed from the Nav Bar. All scores and players are saved in local storage to allow for Tic-Tac-Toe marathons if you feel up to the challenge.

### Safety warning

Tic-Tac-Toe is a pretty intense game on its own, however be warned that should you stumble across a link to a super-top-secret-super-intense version of the game, let the pretty colours be a clue that this version is not safe for anyone who suffers from photosensitive epilepsy.
